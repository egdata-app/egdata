        Fair Use Policy for EGData App
      </h1>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">1. Introduction</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Welcome to EGData App ("we", "our", "us"). This Fair Use Policy outlines
        the terms under which you may use the content and data provided on our
        website{' '}
        <a href="https://egdata.app" className="text-blue-500">
          https://egdata.app
        </a>{' '}
        (the "Site").
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">2. Purpose of Fair Use</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The content and data on EGData App are provided for informational
        purposes only. Our goal is to offer a comprehensive database of games
        (or game related data) available in the Epic Games Store for educational
        and reference use by the community.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">
        3. Compliance with Fair Use
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        EGData App complies with the principles of fair use under copyright law
        by providing information and data in a manner that benefits the public
        without infringing on the rights of content owners. Here are the key
        factors that justify our use as fair use:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>
          <strong>Purpose and Character of Use:</strong> Our website is
          non-commercial and aims to educate and inform the public about games
          available in the Epic Games Store. We provide critical information,
          reviews, and updates, enhancing the public's knowledge and
          appreciation of these games.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Nature of the Copyrighted Work:</strong> The data we collect
          and present consists of factual information such as game titles,
          release dates, developers, and updates. Factual information is less
          protected under copyright law than creative works.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Amount and Substantiality:</strong> We only use the amount of
          data necessary to provide meaningful and relevant information to our
          users. We do not reproduce entire works or provide extensive extracts
          that could replace the original products.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Effect on the Market:</strong> Our use of game data does not
          negatively impact the market for the original games. Instead, it
          promotes these games by providing up-to-date information and driving
          user engagement and interest.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">
        4. Data Collection and Updates
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Our Site automatically tracks and updates game data to ensure that the
        information we provide is current and accurate. This automated process
        involves collecting publicly available information from the Epic Games
        Store and other reliable sources.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        By keeping our database up-to-date, we ensure that users have access to
        the latest information about their favorite games, including new
        releases, updates, and changes in availability.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        In terms of graphical assets, we load the images from the Epic Games
        Store servers directly. We do not store any images on our servers.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">5. Leaked Data Disclaimer</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Any data that appears to be leaked on our Site comes from publicly
        available information provided by the Epic Games Store. We do not have
        access to confidential or proprietary data that is not publicly
        accessible. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the publishers to
        protect their upcoming intellectual properties (IPs), games,
        downloadable content (DLCs), and other sensitive information within the
        Epic Games Developer portal.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Publishers are encouraged to ensure that sensitive information is
        properly secured and not inadvertently made public. EGData App cannot be
        held responsible for any leaked information that was obtained from
        publicly available sources.
